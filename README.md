# Eagler Relay Server
Made by lax1dude

Simply run "java -jar EaglerSPRelay.jar" in your command line in the folder.

Credits also to Elite4r, I found it on his page so don't give me any credit fr.

Go star his project https://github.com/Elite4r/eaglerRelay

Enter the relay address in your client in this format "wss://address:port" You find this the same way as you would find a minecraft server's IP address through port forwarding etc.
